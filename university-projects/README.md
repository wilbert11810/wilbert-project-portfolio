# University Projects

This folder contains academic projects completed during my Bachelor of Computer Science at Swinburne University. These projects span advanced computing units and demonstrate my understanding of key software development principles, including concurrency, architecture, and AI integration.

## ðŸ“š Projects Overview

| Unit | Tech Stack | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `COS40003-ConcurrentProgramming` | C++, Threads | Lab exercises and assignments on concurrency, parallelism, and thread management |
| `SWE30003-SoftwareArchitectures` | UML, Design Patterns | Architectural design and documentation for scalable systems |
| `COS30002-AIforGames` | Python, Game AI | AI-driven game logic and decision-making algorithms for interactive environments |

Each unit folder includes:
- Assignment code
- Documentation
- Learning reflections

These projects reflect my academic growth and technical depth across multiple computing paradigms.
